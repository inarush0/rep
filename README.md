# Find your representatives
This web app will find your US representatives based on your location.
Currently uses your zip code, but this is not an accurate method of lookup. The app will soon use your full address to find your specific representatives (thanks gerrymandering!)

I am using SemaphoreCI to deploy to a DigitalOcean droplet running a Docker container. You can find the master branch running here: http://138.197.37.100:8080/

This is a project to learn Golang and to flex my developer muscles.
